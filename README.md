# Introducing-Vanessa-Goth

My name is Vanessa Goth, and this is all about me!

My full name is Vanessa Elizabeth Goth, I was born on August 17th 2003, and I am 14 years old. I have lived in Ottawa, Ontaria  all of my life, and i attended W.O.Mitchell E.S from SK-grade 8, and in junior kindergarten I attended John Young E.S. I have no siblings, but my mom's nameis Tricia Goth, and my dad's is Craig Goth. I have a dog named Thorton, and a cat named Shadow that are basically my siblings. My interests mainly revolve around horses, and I have been riding horses for 6 years. I listen to a variety of different music genres, from country to rap. I currently don't have a favourite song, there are too many to choose from! My favourite move would hands-down be _IT_, and my favourite actor would have to be Cole Sprouse.

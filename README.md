# Introducing-Vanessa-Goth
My name is Vanessa Goth, and this is all about me!

#### A Little Bit About Myself
My full name is Vanessa Elizabeth Goth, I was born on August 17th 2003, and I am 14 years old. I have lived in Ottawa, Ontario  all of my life, and I attended W.O.Mitchell E.S from SK-grade 8, and in junior kindergarten I attended John Young E.S. I have no siblings, but my mom's name is Tricia Goth, and my dad's is Craig Goth. I have a dog named Thorton, and a cat named Shadow that are basically my siblings. 

#### My Interests
My interests mainly revolve around horses, and I have been riding horses for 6 years. I listen to a variety of different music genres, from country to rap. I currently don't have a favourite song, there are too many to choose from! My favourite move would hands-down be _IT_, and my favourite actor would have to be Cole Sprouse. My favourite food would probably be fettucine alfredo, and I really don't know why, but i've liked it ever since I was young. 

#### More About Me!
I don't have a part-time job at the moment, but during the summer I was volunteering at Wesley Clover Parks horseback riding camp. I am hoping to go back next year for a part-time job. My strengths would be that I am hardworking; I consistantly work hard to make sure that my assignments are done on time, and so I don't fall behind on my work, and I am loyal; I have had the same 2 best friends for 9 years, and I do my best to not betray their trust. My biggest weakness would have to be that I procrastinate a _lot_. I'm trying to get better at not leaving tasks to the last possible moment... I speak fluent English and French, and i can understand and speak a select few words in spanish. For my favourite joke to work, you have to read it out loud; what do you call a fish without an "i"? a fsh! Get it? In my experience in BTT10, I was really hoping to learn about the softwares used to run businesses, and just overall how businesses are created and how they work. I was hoping to learn about the aspects of a successfull business and what helps them run smoothly.
